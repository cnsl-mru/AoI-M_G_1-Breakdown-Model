## On the Age of Status Updates in Unreliable Multi-Source M/G/1 Queueing Systems


### Abstract: 
The timeliness of status message delivery in communications networks is subjective to time-varying wireless channel transmissions. In this letter, we investigate the age of information (AoI) of each source in a multi-source M/G/1 queueing update system with active server failures. In particular, we adopt the method of supplementary variables to derive a closed-form expression for the average AoI in terms of system parameters, where the server repair time follows a general distribution and the service time of packets generated by independent sources is a general random variable. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed packet serving policy under different parametric settings.
